Description: A compilation of functions for performing calculations and
    creating plots that commonly arise in geotechnical engineering and soil
    mechanics. The types of calculations that are currently included are:
    (1) phase diagrams and index parameters, (2) grain-size distributions, 
    (3) plasticity, (4) soil classification, (5) compaction, (6) groundwater,
    (7) subsurface stresses (geostatic and induced), (8) Mohr circle analyses,
    (9) consolidation settlement and rate, (10) shear strength, (11) bearing
    capacity, (12) lateral earth pressures, (13) slope stability, and (14)
    subsurface explorations. Geotechnical engineering students, educators,
    researchers, and practitioners will find this package useful.
